                    <p>Welcome to my minimalist website! </p>
                    <p>I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Environmental Statistics Research Group at KAUST, in Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦. I am fortunate enough to have a job that really fulfills me, and to live on the beautiful KAUST campus in Thuwal, situated by the Red Sea. My research interests include computational statistics, fuzzy set theory, and time series data mining, among others. Outside of work, I am passionate about investing and travelling the world with my wife! </p>
                    <p>A bit on my background. I was born and grew up in Cedeira, a small and beautiful town located in northern Spain 🇪🇸, in a region called Galicia, which I encourage you to visit. I did my bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD degrees in Spain. During my period as a PhD Candidate, I did research stays in Australia 🇦🇺, Germany 🇩🇪, Italy 🇮🇹, and the United Kingdom 🇬🇧. After receiving my PhD at age 28, I decided it was time for new adventures and challenges, so I decided to leave Spain and relocate to the Middle East. Fortunately, moving to Saudi Arabia turned out to be one of the best decisions I have made in my life so far! </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Travelling</h2>
                    <p>One of my favorite things in life is travelling. I love exploring new places and immersing myself in their history, culture, and people. I usually travel with just a small bag 🎒 and my mobile phone 📱, which are all I need to visit every corner of the world. When travelling, I strive to fully immerse myself in local life and avoid tourist areas unless absolutely necessary. As Rolf Potts says in his fantastic book, <em>Vagabonding</em>: <q>Indeed, the most vivid travel experiences usually find you by accident, and the qualities that will make you fall in love with a place are rarely the features that took you there</q>.</p>
                    <p>So far, I have visited 38 countries and hope to see that number grow in the coming years. However, it's not the number of countries you visit what matters most, but the experiences you have in each one. Many people hop from country to country, posting Instagram photos to show off without truly enjoying the experience. These people are not real travellers. Don't be one of them! Once you understand this, there's nothing wrong with counting the countries you've visited. In fact, I track mine in a funny way by coloring a world map whose updated version can be accessed <a href="map.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 
		    <p>While it's impossible to pick just one country as my favorite, Japan 🇯🇵 stands out as the most surprising with its natural beauty, rich culture, and the incredible warmth of its people. Other places that left me in awe include the landscapes of Bali (Indonesia 🇮🇩), the beaches of New South Wales (Australia 🇦🇺), and the ancient streets of Cairo (Egypt 🇪🇬). However, I'm not a fan of top lists because every place in the world is unique and offers its own special experiences! </p>

                <div class="resume-section-content">
                    <h2 class="mb-5">Investing</h2>
                    <p>I have a keen interest in personal finance 💰 and investing 📈, which led me to discover the Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) community several years ago. The FIRE movement, popularized by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin in their book <em>Your Money or Your Life</em>, emphasizes extreme saving and investing with the goal of retiring significantly earlier than traditional methods typically allow. FIRE enthusiasts strive to attain financial freedom, enabling them to choose how they spend their time.</p>
		    <p> While I'm not a fan of the FIRE movement in its purest form (since I believe the ultimate goal should be finding a job you love rather than stopping work altogether, and I hope I never retire from academia!), I do think everyone can benefit from the core principles of saving and investing that FIRE promotes. In fact, I apply these principles myself to some extent.</p>
		    <p> Although there are many investing strategies available, my preferred one is called lazy investing 💤. This approach involves investing in a few low-cost index funds and holding them for the long term. Two of my favorite finance books, <em>The Simple Path to Wealth</em>, by J.L. Collins, and <em>The Bogleheads' Guide to the Three-Fund Portfolio</em>, by Taylor Larimore, explain this strategy in detail. One aspect of lazy investing that I particularly like is that it requires minimal effort while outperforming the majority of active investing strategies (there are tons of research studies supporting this claim; see, for instance, this <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-passive-investing-is-best-for-almost-everyone-saving-for-retirement-140157653.html">article</a>). My current lazy portfolio (managed by the great Spanish neobank <a href="https://myinvestor.es">MyInvestor</a>) is based on a balanced strategy considering 50% stocks and 50% bonds (advocated by Benjamin Graham, Jack Bogle, and many others). In particular, my portfolio consists of the following index funds and their respective allocations:	
		    <ul style="margin-left: -10px">
                      <li>Fidelity S&P 500 Index Fund P-ACC-EUR (IE00BYX5MX67): 25%.</li>
                      <li>Fidelity MSCI World Index Fund P-ACC-EUR (IE00BYX5NX33): 25%. This fund overlaps with the previous one, making my total allocation in the S&P 500 and non-US stocks around 40% and 10%, respectively.</li>
                      <li>Vanguard Global Bond Index Fund EUR Hedged Acc (IE00B18GC888): 50%.</li>
                      </ul></p>	    
                    <p> Regardless of your financial preferences, I strongly encourage you to start investing today, since, in my humble opinion, it is crucial for your long-term financial well-being. It is alarming how many people do not understand the importance of investing (I was one of them some years ago 🤦🏻‍♂️), which is why I have included this section on my website. Getting started with investing is probably the most important financial decision that you can make today, and I am not exaggerating! </p>
